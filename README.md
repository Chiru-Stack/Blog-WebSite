# Blog Website Project

Welcome to the repository for our Blog Website project! This project is built using a stack of modern web technologies including **EJS**, **CSS**, **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. Below, you'll find an overview of our project and its goals.

## About the Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a versatile and user-friendly blog website that allows users to read and write articles on a wide range of topics. We aim to provide a platform for sharing knowledge, experiences, and creative content with our community.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Content:** We use EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to create dynamic and responsive web pages, making the user experience enjoyable on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Stylish Design:** Our CSS styles are carefully crafted to provide an aesthetically pleasing and visually appealing design, with a dark theme for comfortable reading.

- **Server-Side Logic:** Express.js and Node.js power the backend, handling routes, user authentication, and interactions with our MongoDB database.

- **Database Integration:** MongoDB is used as the database to store articles, user data, and other essential information securely.
